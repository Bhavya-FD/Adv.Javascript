    <h1>Hoisting in JavaScript</h1>
    <p>Hoisting is a concept or behavior in JavaScript where the declaration of a function, 
        variable, or class goes to the top of the scope they were defined in.</p>
    <p>In JavaScript, Hoisting is the default behavior of moving all the
        declarations at the top of the scope before code execution. Basically, it
        gives us an advantage that no matter where functions and variables are
        declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether
        their scope is global or local.</p>
    <p>Function Declaration are hoisted but Function Expressions are Not Hoisted.</p>

    <script>
        
        // Hoisting make this work
        sum();                      //Access a Function Before Execution
        
        function sum(a,b) {
            a = 10;
            b = 20;
            console.log(a+b);
            console.log("This is an Addition");
        }

        console.log(add);           //ReferenceError: Cannot access 'add' before initialization
        
        let a = 10;
        let b = 20;
        const add = a+b;

    //     greet();

    //   function greet() {
    //     console.log("Namaste Bharat");
    //   }
    //   greetArrow();

    //   const greetArrow = () => {
    //     console.log("Namaste Bharat");
    //   };
