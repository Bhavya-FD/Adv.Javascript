    <h1>Call Back Function</h1>
    <p>Javascript is Syncronous Single Threaded Language but it also performs some Asyncronous task as well.</p>
    <p>A <b>callback</b> is a function that is passed as an argument to another function, and is called after the main function has finished its execution.</p>
    <p>Callbacks allow you to continue executing code while the operation is being executed in the background. Once the operation has completed, the callback function is called with the result of the operation.</p>


    <script>
        function mainFunction(callback) {
            console.log("Performing operation...");
            // Use setTimeout to simulate an asynchronous operation
            setTimeout(function() {
                console.log("Operation complete");
                // callback("Operation complete");
            }, 1000);
        }
        mainFunction();
        // function callbackFunction(result) {
        //       console.log("Result: " + result);
        // }
 
// Call the main function with the callback function
// mainFunction(callbackFunction);
