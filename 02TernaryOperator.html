    <h1>Ternary Operator</h1>
    <p>The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes <br>
        three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), <br> and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. This operator is frequently used as an alternative to an if...else statement.</p>
    <p> Syntax: <br>
        let result = condition ? value1 : value2;</p>

    <script>
        let age = prompt("What is your Age : ")
        const permit = age>18 ? "You can Drive!": "You can't Drive!"
        alert(permit);
        // age > 18 ? alert("you can Drive"): alert("you can't Drive")     //this condition can also be Written
    </script>
